# Calories Burn Prediction System - How To

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the Calories Burn Prediction System to estimate the number of calories burned during exercise sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before using the system, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system
- Required dependencies installed (refer to [Dependencies](README.md#dependencies) in README.md)
- Access to the dataset exercise_dataset.csv

## Steps

Follow these steps to use the Calories Burn Prediction System:

1. *Clone the Repository:*

   Clone the repository containing the system code and dataset to your local machine:
   
   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   

2. *Navigate to the Project Directory:*

   Open a terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the project directory:

   bash
   cd <project_directory>
   

3. *Install Dependencies:*

   Install the required dependencies using pip:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. *Download Dataset:*

   Ensure you have downloaded the dataset exercise_dataset.csv and placed it in the project directory.

5. *Run the Prediction Script:*

   Execute the Python script calories_prediction.py to train the model and make predictions:

   bash
   python calories_prediction.py
   

6. *View Results:*

   After running the script, the system will display the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and predictions for the test data. You can analyze the results to evaluate the model's performance.

7. *Customize Inputs (Optional):*

   If you wish to customize input data or experiment with different parameters, you can modify the script calories_prediction.py accordingly.

8. *Interpret Results:*

   Analyze the predicted calorie burn values to estimate the number of calories burned during various exercise sessions based on different factors such as gender, age, weight, height, exercise type, and weather conditions.
